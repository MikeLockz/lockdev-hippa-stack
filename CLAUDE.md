# HIPAA-Compliant Infrastructure Stack

## Project Overview
This project creates HIPAA, HITRUST, and SOC2 compliant infrastructure for a health tech company using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Pulumi and Python. The architecture supports multi-cloud deployments (AWS primary, GCP secondary) and includes a containerized hello world application.

## Repository Structure
This directory contains two separate repositories:
- `lockdev-hippa-iac/` - Pulumi Python infrastructure code
- `lockdev-hippa-app/` - Hello World Python web application

## Architecture Components

### Core Infrastructure
- **VPC & Networking**: Public/private subnets, NAT gateways, security groups
- **Compute**: ECS Fargate containers with auto-scaling
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL with encryption and automated backups
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer with SSL termination
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway with authentication/authorization
- **Container Registry**: ECR for Docker images

### Security & Compliance
- **Encryption**: KMS key management, encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: IAM roles with least privilege, MFA requirements
- **Audit Logging**: CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, application logs
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, X-Ray tracing, GuardDuty, Config
- **Network Security**: Private subnets, security groups, NACLs, WAF

### HIPAA/HITRUST Compliance Features
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Access logging and audit trails
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Automated backup and disaster recovery
- Vulnerability scanning and monitoring
- Data loss prevention (DLP) policies
